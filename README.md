Real Estate ROI & CLP Simulator
A powerful, all-in-one financial simulator designed to help real estate investors in India make informed decisions. This tool goes beyond simple EMI calculations to provide a detailed year-on-year cash flow analysis, incorporating complex scenarios like under-construction properties with Construction-Linked Plans (CLPs), rental income, and various exit strategies.

This is a self-contained HTML file built with vanilla JavaScript and styled with Tailwind CSS. There are no external dependencies or build steps required.

Key Features
Comprehensive Cost Analysis: Automatically calculates total acquisition cost, including property value, developer charges, stamp duty, and registration fees based on the selected state.

Advanced Loan Simulation:

Models Pre-EMI payments for under-construction properties based on a customizable disbursement schedule.

Calculates Full EMI payments (Principal + Interest) post-possession.

Flexible Timeline & Expense Modeling:

Specify the exact year for property registration, and the tool will only factor in the cost for that year.

Model detailed rental income by setting the rent start year, initial rent, annual escalation, and one-time fit-out costs.

Input a realistic maintenance schedule with one-time advance payments and recurring monthly fees.

Multiple Exit Scenarios: Don't rely on a single appreciation rate. Define multiple exit strategies by setting a holding period (in years) and a target sale price (per sq. ft.) to see which performs best.

Key Performance Indicators (KPIs): For each scenario, the tool instantly calculates the most important financial metrics:

IRR (Internal Rate of Return): The true annualized return on your investment.

Net Profit: The total absolute profit after all inflows and outflows.

CAGR (Compounded Annual Growth Rate): The year-over-year growth rate of your initial investment.

Detailed Cash Flow Analysis: View a year-on-year breakdown of all your cash inflows (rent, sale) and outflows (EMI, maintenance, taxes, etc.) to understand the complete financial picture.

User-Friendly Interface:

A clean, single-page application for ease of use.

Save & Load Functionality: Automatically saves your last used inputs to your browser's local storage and reloads them on your next visit. No need to re-enter data every time!
